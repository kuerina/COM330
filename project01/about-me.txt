I consider myself a deep learner passionate about prepare myself to confront hard problems with simple solutions.
Computer engineering has taugh me how hardware makes possible programability from a bottom-up perspective
, and so far my favorite programming language has been MC68k because I can understand more or less the
process needed to perform an instruction. Once languages are lost in abstraction, it is far harder to keep
up with the actual implementation of our programs and time complexity becomes really an issue.

Since humans make problems easier to understand (or harder) by using abstractions, it is imperative to learn
how to deal with it. For this reason I am complementing my engineering degree with a masters in Computer science. 
I hope I can use my understanding of hardware to make abstract problems faster to compute. The facinating
problems that I hope to learn from computer science are the ones found in datamining, social network analysis,
machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
